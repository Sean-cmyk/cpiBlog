    <h1>Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h1>
    <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a vital economic indicator that measures changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by households. It serves as a key tool for monitoring inflation and assessing changes in the cost of living for consumers.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Calculation of CPI:</strong></p>
      <p>The CPI is calculated by selecting a basket of representative goods and services commonly purchased by consumers. These items are assigned weights based on their relative importance in the average consumer's expenditure. Price data for the selected items are collected regularly, and the changes in prices are used to calculate the CPI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Uses of CPI:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measuring Inflation: The CPI is used to track inflation rates and assess the impact of price changes on the purchasing power of consumers.</li>
        <li>Cost-of-Living Adjustments: The CPI is used to adjust wages, salaries, and benefits to account for changes in the cost of living.</li>
        <li>Economic Analysis: Economists and policymakers analyze CPI data to understand trends in price levels, identify inflationary pressures, and formulate appropriate economic policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="content-info">The CPI is often segmented into various categories, such as <span>food</span>, <span>housing</span>, <span>transportation</span>, <span>healthcare</span>, and <span>education</span>. This allows for a more detailed analysis of price changes in specific sectors of the economy.</p>

    <p class="content-info">It's important to note that the CPI has some limitations. It represents average price changes and may not accurately reflect the individual experiences of all consumers. Additionally, changes in quality, new product introductions, and shifts in consumer preferences can impact the CPI's accuracy.</p>

    <p class="content-info">Despite its limitations, the CPI remains a crucial tool for understanding inflation and its impact on consumers' purchasing power. It provides valuable insights into changes in the cost of living and is widely used by economists, policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike.</p>
